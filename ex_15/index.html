        <h2>Staff 'terrified' of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling: Former assistant</h2>
        <p>Harry Potter billionaire J.K. Rowling’s staff were “terrified” of the author’s wild mood swings, a former personal assistant has testified.<br><br>
        As well she might.<br><br>
        Amanda Donaldson, 35, is accused of stealing more than $40,000 from Rowling. Donaldson has denied using the author’s credit card on a wild spending spree.<br>
        The former PA told a British court that Rowling was “unapproachable” and staff were wary of her unpredictable moods.<br><br>
        “Approachable isn’t something I would say,” Donaldson said of the writer. “People in the office would sometimes ask if she was in a good mood, in a terrified way.”<br>
        She insisted the purchases she made were for the business and done while Rowling was penning her next bestseller.<br><br>
        Rowling’s husband, Dr. Neil Murray, earlier slammed Donaldson as a “liar” and accused her of stealing Harry Potter merchandise stored in the office that was to be sent to sick children.<br><br>
